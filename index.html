                    <p>For getting admission into BBM course, priority is given to the students who have cleared 10+2 with commerce as the main
                         subject. Luckily I completed 10+2 with commerce and scored good percentile in the same as well.
                        Course Curriculum Overview: My college offers so many UG and PG courses, I always wanted to do business
                         management course. I like the course content as it is designed to offer practical knowledge as well besides classroom lectures.
